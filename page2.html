    <p>Turkish Cypriots strive to gain worldwide recognition as the divided island remains only partially recognized. Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) President Ersin Tatar once again brought the issue to the spotlight in New York, where the U.N. General Assembly convened last week.“Our state, which we established with our free will, needs to be recognized,” Tatar said, speaking with Turkish Cypriots in New York, where he traveled to hold talks amid last week’s U.N. General Assembly. According to a statement on Sunday by his presidential office, Tatar underlined that recognition of the TRNC and cooperation could bring stability to the entire region. He said Turkish Cypriots living abroad were united and always connected to their homeland, highlighting the importance that future generations maintain their ties with the TRNC. Tatar also acknowledged the support that Ankara provides in this regard, pointing out President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s address to the assembly, where he expressed the need to end injustices against Turkish Cypriots, end the ongoing embargo and isolation of the TRNC, and recognize its independence. This support is crucial for promoting and gaining recognition for their just cause worldwide, Tatar said. He also stressed the importance of enhancing relationships with different countries, emphasizing that the TRNC was the homeland where Turkish Cypriots could live independently in the future.</p>

    <p>President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made a spontaneous visit on Monday to the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan. Announced one day before, the visit comes on the heels of Azerbaijan's successful counterterrorism operation in Karabakh, a region regained from Armenia which, last week, was cleared of Armenian separatists.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev welcomed Erdoğan in an official ceremony before the two leaders headed for talks. The purpose of Erdoğan's visit is the inauguration of a pipeline between Türkiye's Iğdır and Nakchivan, and two leaders are also expected to attend the opening of a military complex in the exclave. Nakchivan, which shares Azerbaijan's only land border with Türkiye, is surrounded by Armenian territories. So, Erdoğan's visit was symbolic in the aftermath of the victory against Armenian separatists. Azerbaijan and Türkiye are the most intimate allies in the region, with their intertwined history as two Turkic nations. Erdoğan further advanced ties thanks to his close friendship with Aliyev. Two leaders call each other "brothers," and Türkiye is the most outspoken advocate of Azerbaijan's rights over Karabakh, forcibly taken by Armenia after the collapse of the USSR.At a joint news conference with Aliyev, Erdoğan praised the counterterrorism operation. "We are proud that it was completed in a very short time and we wish blessings from Allah for our martyred brothers," Erdoğan said, referring to fallen Azerbaijani soldiers.Erdoğan also addressed Armenian authorities and called on them to accept the "hand of peace" Azerbaijan extended to them and take "sincere steps." He noted that the developments in the region "opened a new window of opportunity" for normalization in the broader region.</p>

    <p>The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) is determined to increase domestic and international demand for lira assets, its Governor Hafize Gaye Erkan said Monday.In a speech, Erkan also said, "The preliminary indicators show the share of lira assets is starting to increase in domestic and foreign investor portfolios. The messages of the central bank governor delivered at the opening of the OIC-COMCEC Central Banks Forum Meeting, which was closed to the press, were shared on the official social media account of the bank on X, formerly Twitter."We will continue to resolutely implement our road map to establish disinflation in 2024," Anadolu Agency (AA) cited Erkan as saying.Annual inflation rose to nearly 60% in August, with authorities acknowledging it is expected to increase further toward the end of the year. It had reached a 24-year high of 85.5% last October and stood at 47.83% this July after regressing to as low as 38.21% in June.The bank on Thursday raised its key interest rate by a lofty 500 basis points to 30%, marking a second month of aggressive tightening after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan expressed his strongest pledge of support for the economy team's policy overhaul.Earlier on Monday, according to local media reports, the bank removed the minimum interest requirement for the Turkish lira conversion rate in FX-protected accounts.Hence, the central bank took additional steps to support lira deposits and continues its steps with determination to transform it to make it attractive, AA reported.The bank in August began rolling back a government-backed scheme that safeguards Turkish lira deposits against foreign exchange depreciation, marking another move toward more orthodox policies following a shift toward interest rate hikes.</p>

    <p>The East Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been mired in a decadeslong dispute between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, despite a series of diplomatic efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement. Ethnic attacks starting in the early 1960s forced Turkish Cypriots to withdraw into enclaves for their safety. In 1974, a Greek Cypriot coup aimed at Greece’s annexation of the island led to Türkiye’s military intervention as a guarantor power to protect Turkish Cypriots from persecution and violence. The TRNC was founded in 1983. It has seen an on-and-off peace process in recent years, including a failed 2017 initiative in Switzerland under the auspices of guarantor countries Türkiye, Greece and the U.K. The Greek Cypriot administration was admitted to the EU in 2004, the same year when Greek Cypriots thwarted a U.N. plan to end the longstanding dispute.</p>

<p> For his part, Aliyev said Armenians surrendered and accepted Azerbaijan's conditions after the Karabakh operation. He noted that they delivered humanitarian aid to Armenian locals of Karabakh. He assured that Azerbaijan would provide security for the people of Karabakh.

Aliyev thanked Erdoğan for his support to Azerbaijan. "My dear brother, you were in the United States when this happened. There, at the highest level, you voiced your support for the state of Azerbaijan," he said, referring to a United Nations General Assembly speech by Erdoğan. "You and the people of Türkiye were with us. People of Azerbaijan will never forget this," he said. The Azerbaijani president stressed that they favored peace, "not war," in Karabakh and the wider region.

Karabakh has been quiet after last week's operation, but Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry announced on Monday that two Azerbaijani soldiers were killed and another was injured when their military truck hit an antitank land mine planted by Armenian forces in the region. It was the deaths of several Azerbaijani soldiers by a land mine that prompted Azerbaijan to launch a counterterrorism offensive against separatists.

    <p>With this recent move, the lira deposits would be more desirable than FX-protected deposits.

The bank has not stated the latest regulation.

As part of its earlier undertaken steps, the bank increased the invoice exemption limit for export and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) loans to ease the credit flow to TL 250,000 ($9,188) from TL 50,000.

Last week, Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek said Türkiye had secured a combined $10.4 billion in financing from abroad since June, as it embraced more conventional policies to tackle inflation after a long-running easing trend.

"Our president's full support for our policies to take inflation under control is the most important factor that increases confidence in our policy framework," Şimşek said, expressing beliefs that his meetings with investors in the United States would contribute to the foreign inflows to Türkiye.

After his reelection in May, Erdoğan reshuffled his economy team and named two accomplished bankers, including Şimşek and CBRT Governor Erkan.

President Erdoğan reiterated Thursday that "he believes" in his new economy team and said he "hoped" they would start seeing the results of the new economic policies in the first quarter of 2024.
